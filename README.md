| `analyze.js`         | API endpoint that sends audio to OpenAI Whisper for transcription and then summarizes it via GPT. |
| `summarize.js`       | API endpoint that receives full transcripts and returns structured JSON summaries. |
| `save.js`            | Saves each transcript and summary to Supabase.                          |
| `get.js`             | Fetches the latest summary from Supabase for polling by UI.            |
